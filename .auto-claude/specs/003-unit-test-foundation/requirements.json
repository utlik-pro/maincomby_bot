  "task_description": "# Unit Test Foundation\n\nEstablish automated testing infrastructure with Vitest, React Testing Library, and initial test coverage for critical components and business logic.\n\n## Rationale\nCurrently there is no test coverage (identified as technical debt). As features grow, lack of tests increases bug risk and slows development. Starting with critical paths establishes testing culture early.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a developer, I want automated tests so I can refactor with confidence\n- As a maintainer, I want CI tests so bugs are caught before deployment\n- As a contributor, I want test examples so I know how to test new features\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Vitest and React Testing Library configured in project\n- [ ] Test scripts added to package.json\n- [ ] Unit tests for XP calculation and rank progression logic\n- [ ] Component tests for critical UI components (ProfileCard, EventCard)\n- [ ] Integration tests for Supabase authentication flow\n- [ ] CI pipeline runs tests on pull requests\n- [ ] Code coverage reporting enabled\n",
